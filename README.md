# SongCutter
cuts the begining and end off a song

Dependencies:
 - Python3
 - ffmpeg
 - pyDub

I use media human's youtube to mp3 converter for my offline music playlist. However, some channels like to put silence in the begining and end of a song for title screens and whatnot so I made a script to cut those off. 

using:
run the bash script to install dependencies then put the pythion script in the same folder as your playlist and run it from a terminal. 

# only for use on linux systems
 - tested on Ubuntu 20.04
